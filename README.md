Python - Tkinter

First window :
Button -1) Login
Button -2) Register

we write a program that opens a window with fields: username and password and a button to submit these values.
User can enter the details for username, password; and click on Login button.
Once the button is clicked, a function is called to validate the credentials.
That's how it works.
